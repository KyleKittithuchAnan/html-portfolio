<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">
    My background portrays a person who may not be naturally gifted but is dedicated and perseveres. I grew up in
    Sikhoraphum District, Surin Province, Thailand. Where the local school wasn't among the province's top institutions.
    Despite this, I excelled
    academically and was placed in the top three classes throughout high school. This achievement granted me the
    opportunity to attend Mahidol University, one of the country's prestigious institutions, where I earned a bachelor's
    degree in Physics Science (B.Sc.).

    Following graduation, I embarked on a teaching career, tutoring middle and high school students in math and science
    for 3-4 months before transitioning to the IT field. My first role was as a software developer, despite lacking
    prior coding knowledge. Through connections and self-directed learning, I quickly acquired the necessary skills.
    Within a year, my efforts were rewarded with a promotion and an 80% salary increase, aligning with the standard IT
    market rates in Thailand.

    After another year, I sought new challenges and joined a larger company, collaborating with international
    colleagues. This role demanded expertise in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Node-RED, Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch,
    Logstash, Kibana), Docker, Amazon Web Services (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Kubernetes), and Git. I also gained
    experience in building chatbots for diverse industries, accumulating over four years of IT experience.

    Seeking further opportunities, my family and I relocated to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, just over a year ago. While I
    continue to pursue IT opportunities, I've embraced every chance, whether volunteer or entry-level, while also
    working as a cook at a Foothill Medical Centre to support my family. Even after work, I dedicate myself to
    continuous learning, studying to enhance my skills and broaden my knowledge. Currently, I'm focused on acquiring
    full-stack development skills and plan to further my education in Python, Go, DevOps, and DevSecOps.
